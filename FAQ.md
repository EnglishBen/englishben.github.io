**What are your internet speeds?**

900 down, 200 up

**Streamer are you blind?**

Sort of. Most people have a ‘strong’ eye and a weak eye. I am extremely short-sighted in my left eye, and have what’s called a strabismus in my right eye (eye cannot focus properly) basically meaning I have two weak eyes. This means my eyesight is very poor, and this causes issues in speedruns as my perception isn’t good enough to see everything around me.  Glasses/contact lenses do not help my condition, the only option is expensive surgery (we’re talking thousands). I don’t usually talk about it on stream unless somebody asks so it’s understandable that most people aren’t aware, perhaps writing about it properly in here will add a little clarity.

**I heard you moved to Sweden?**

I moved to Sweden in July 2020, thanks to my friend Marcus allowing me to stay with him while I sort out all the huge issues with moving countries mid-Brexit. I’m currently back in the UK as my mother was quite sick in 2021, but I plan to move back eventually.

**Why Sweden?**


Here’s a few reasons - 

It’s my favourite country I’ve ever visited

I have a lot of friends there

It’s a nice location in Europe

It doesn’t cost £409496548396 to study

Health benefits

Higher quality of living

I can get dual citizenship

I keep my right to travel freely within the EU

### GTA 3

**Why are you stopping and playing replays in random places?**

They aren’t random, you can grab pick ups such as rampages from within replays. This is useful to remotely start them and manipulating the game’s $ON_MISSION variable in order to do a lot of cool stuff. 

**How are you super jumping?**

Megajumps are a trick that also involve replays, frankly I have no idea why they occur but they are pretty useful. You can find a video I made on how to execute them with inputs [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxIki8J3GCA)

**Why are you changing the camera so much?**

Changing to the top down camera despawns traffic, so this makes driving somewhat easier.

###GTA Vice City

**Why is the game in chinese?**

It isn’t.

**Why is the game in Korean?**

It isn’t.

**Why is the game in japanese?**

The japanese version of Vice City is used because the .scm is different to the international version due to a re-release. This ‘haitian friendly’ version has several instapasses that are faster than the international/steam version, such as the Cherry Poppers instapass used in No SSU.

**What is SSU?**

SSU stands for Script Stack Underflow and is a glitch that allows you to complete Vice City in under 10 minutes. A detailed summary can be found [here](https://www.speedrun.com/gtavc/guides/0h9mr)

**Why are you starting Distribution over and over?**

With specific setups, you can chain instapasses of Cherry Poppers together. This is useful as it skips having to do 5 normal assets to unlock the final 2 missions. Instead, you can just instapass cherry poppers 5 times to reach the end of the game.

**How can I get into speedrunning this game?**

I have video tutorials for [Any% No SSU](https://youtu.be/zCiqoZusRGc?si=wLNgkzaf4clP0bpJ) and [All Missions](https://youtu.be/-aBxGhQDL9E?si=xkFVQ_cHv4uMPUHL) that you can check out. If you’re new to running the game, I would recommend No SSU as it is fairly easy to learn and my guide is based around beginners.

### GTA San Andreas

**Why do you blow up...**

Shut up

**How do you not have a wanted level?**

Information on the zero star glitch can be found [here](https://www.speedrun.com/gtasa/forums/1alhj)

**What on earth is MDvMM?**

Mission Duplication via Memory Manipulation. It’s the best SA category because you can dupe whatever you want, whenever you want to skip huge chunks of that awful game.

**Why are you flicking the camera so much?**

Same as GTA III camera manipulation, it despawns traffic.

**How are you just skipping entire missions?**

In SA, completing one mission twice will skip the next mission in the chain. For example dupe+passing T-Bone Mendez in San Fierro will skip Mike Toreno. It only works in some scenarios, so you can't just dupe Big Smoke a hundred times and skip the entire game.

**Why is the game flickering sometimes?**

This is called pause buffering, it is basically just holding escape to pause and unpause very quickly. This has a number of uses in runs, like timing phone calls or slowing down the game.

**How would I get into running this game?**

I have a tutorial for [No Major Glitches](https://youtu.be/1zoQ6nW7JcE?si=WKWFGrUQ4vvKJj3Y] which is far the most beginner-friendly run for SA.

### THUG1/THUG2/THAW

**How are you jumping so high?**

That’s called buttslapping. The simple idea is dropping off a ledge, doing a fliptrick and then mashing ollie inputs in extremely quick succession afterwards. Video guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEi6r-8x5Yk)

**Why are you mashing in seemingly random places?**

It depends on the situation, but usually it’s to attempt to skip an incoming text box whenever I can.

**How do you do those fast 180s?**

Powerslides are super easy, and are simply a matter of tapping down, down and then revert.

**How would I get into running these games?**

I have video guides for [THUG2](https://youtu.be/rPFf892Syy4?si=AawKaTqtJ_sS0DyG) and [THAW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIi6brNKwM) that you can check out if you’re new. ThePackle has a solid [THUG1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uKX5MEJjRo) guide but I haven’t made one myself yet.
